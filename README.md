# ML_Exploring_WorldWide_Suicide_Rates
#I originally had doubts to put this project in Clustering Repo or create a new repo,but since i put more work than the other clusterings on it i decided to create a new rep
#in the project i used Plotly,Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize a dataset of suicide rate of 101 different countries accross a 20 years span and Clustering them using KMeans
